/*

Producer extends and Consumer super principle

producer extends -> if we want to read from the list we have to declare with it extends
List <? extends T> we can read T values but we cannot add values to T

consumer super-> if we hage to add values to the list we have to declare with super
List<? super T> we can add T values but we cannot read fron this list because we dont know the type

If we want to add AND read at the same time we have to declare collections with no wildcards
For example List<Double> we can add and read Doubles
