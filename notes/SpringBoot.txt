12.Spring vs Spring boot vs Spring MVC
Spring framework feature is dependency injection.At the core of all spring modules is dependency injection or IOC inversion of control.When DI or IOC is properly
used we can develop loosely coupled applications.Loosely coupled applications can be easily unit tested.
Solves duplication/plumbling code
Good integration with other framework.Junit,Mokito

Spring MVC provides simple way of developing web applications.With simple concepts like dispatcher


Spring boot auto configuration.Spring boot started projects,build around well known patterns.
provides starters,monitors.
